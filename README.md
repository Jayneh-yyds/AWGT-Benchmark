# AWGT-Benchmark: An Air-Writing Benchmark Supporting Cross-Scene Text Recognition

## ðŸŒŸ Abstract
We introduce **AWGT (Air-Writing General Text)-Benchmark**, a video-based, multilingual, and multi-granularity dataset designed to advance air-writing text recognition (AWTR) across diverse scenes.  
It consists of **226,648 frames** across four subsets (Chinese/English, Characters/Words), with finger-writing trajectories captured by RGB cameras in real-world environments.  

Based on AWGT, we propose a **two-stage recognition framework** that first extracts finger motion trajectories and then converts them into trajectory images for character recognition. Experimental results show that widely used STR/HTR models degrade significantly under air-writing conditions, highlighting the unique challenges of AWTR.

## ðŸŒŸ Contribution
ðŸš€AWGT-Benchmark: The first large-scale, multilingual, multi-granularity video dataset supporting air-writing text recognition, enabling standardized evaluation across diverse languages and writing levels.

A novel two-stage framework: Decouples fingertip motion extraction from character recognition for improved modularity and robustness, with comprehensive benchmarking of STR/HTR models under air-writing settings.

In-depth analysis: Reveals critical limitations of existing models in AWTR and provides insights toward more generalizable recognition approaches.
