# AWGT-Benchmark: An Air-Writing Benchmark Supporting Cross-Scene Text Recognition
## Abstract
We introduce AWGT (Air-Writing General Text)-Benchmark, a video-based, multilingual, and multigranularity dataset designed to advance air-writing text recognition (AWTR) across diverse scenes. Bridging the gap between conventional text recognition and air-writing scenarios, AWGT poses challenges from both computer vision and natural language processing perspectives. It consists of 226,648 video frames across four subsets in Chinese and English, with finger-writing trajectories captured by RGB cameras in real-world environments to ensure realism and diversity. Based on AWGT, we propose a two-stage recognition framework that first extracts finger motion trajectories and then converts them into trajectory images for character recognition. This design effectively suppresses background noise and emphasizes structural character details. Experimental results on AWGT show that widely used text recognition models suffer significant performance degradation when applied to air-writing tasks, highlighting their limited ability to handle dynamic finger movements and cluttered visual contexts. AWGT-Benchmark provides a unified evaluation protocol and experimental baseline,
reveals key limitations of existing methods, and offers insights for developing more robust and adaptable cross-scene recognition systems. Furthermore, it contributes to advancing research in intelligent human-computer interaction. The dataset will be made publicly available to facilitate future studies.
